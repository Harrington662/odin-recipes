        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My grandmother always made this cornbread dressing for holiday dinners and for family gatherings at other times of the year. Use your favorite cornbread mix to make a batch of cornbread, and then crumble it for use in this family-favorite recipe. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cornbread: This recipe starts with crumbled cornbread. You can buy pre-made cornbread, make it from a mix, or make a from-scratch cornbread recipe.</li>
            <li>Vegetables: You'll need diced onions and celery.</li>
            <li>Butter: Butter is used to saute the fresh vegetables.            </li>
            <li>Eggs: Two eggs add moisture and richness. They also act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dressing together.</li>
            <li>Stock: Use store-bought or homemade chicken stock for more flavor and moisture.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: This cornbread dressing is seasoned with dried sage, salt, and black pepper. Of course, you can adjust the seasonings to taste.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sauté the vegetables in butter until soft.</li>
            <li>Add the sautéed vegetables to the crumbled cornbread.</li>
            <li>Stir in the remaining ingredients and mix until well-combined.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dressing to a prepared baking dish and bake until golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
